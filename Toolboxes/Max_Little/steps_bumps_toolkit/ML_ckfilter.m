% Implements the Chung-Kennedy sliding window nonlinear step filter. This
% filter is similar to a centred moving average filter of length K, but the
% centre sample in the window is replaced by a weighted sum of forward and
% backward moving average filters. The weights are inversely proportional
% to the one-step-ahead error of the forward/backward filters at predicting
% the samples in the sliding window. The prediction error is estimated over
% 2M samples either side of the centre sample in the window. In this
% implementation, forwards/backwards filters of all lengths up to K are
% used. Larger p gives more sensitivity of the forward/backward filter
% weights to the filter prediction error.
%
% Usage:
%  x = ML_ckfilter(y, K, M, p)
%
% Inputs
%  y - Input signal
%  K - Maximum forward/backward moving average filter length (samples)
%  M - Prediction error analysis window size (samples)
%  p - Positive scaling of prediction error
%
% Outputs
%  x - Step-filtered output signal
