% SY_LocalDistributions
% 
% Compares the distribution in consecutive partitions of the signal,
% returning the sum of differences between each kernel-smoothed distributions
% (using the Matlab function ksdensity).
% 
% INPUTS:
% 
% y, the input time series
% 
% nseg, the number of segments to break the time series into
% 
% eachorpar, (i) 'par': compares each local distribution to the parent (full time
%                       series) distribution
%            (ii) 'each': compare each local distribution to all other local
%                         distributions
% 
% npoints, number of points to compute the distribution across (in each local
%          segments)
% 
% The operation behaves in one of two modes: each compares the distribution in
% each segment to that in every other segment, and par compares each
% distribution to the so-called 'parent' distribution, that of the full signal.
% 
% Outputs from the operation are measures of the sum of absolute deviations
% between distributions across the different pairwise comparisons.
