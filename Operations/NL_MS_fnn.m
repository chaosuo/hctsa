% NL_MS_fnn
% 
% Determines the number of false nearest neighbors for the embedded time series
% using Michael Small's false nearest neighbor code, fnn (renamed MS_fnn here)
% 
% cf. M. Small, Applied Nonlinear Time Series Analysis: Applications in Physics,
% Physiology, and Finance (book) World Scientific, Nonlinear Science Series A,
% Vol. 52 (2005)
% Code available at http://small.eie.polyu.edu.hk/matlab/
% 
% False nearest neighbors are judged using a ratio of the distances between the
% next k points and the neighboring points of a given datapoint.
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input time series
% de, the embedding dimensions to compare across (a vector)
% tau, the time-delay (can be 'ac' or 'mi' to be the first zero-crossing of ACF,
%                       or first minimum of AMI, respectively)
% th, the distance threshold for neighbours
% kth, the the distance to next points
% [opt] justbest, can be set to 1 to just return the best embedding dimension, m_{best}
% [opt] bestp, if justbest = 1, can set bestp as the proportion of false nearest
%              neighbours at which the optimal embedding dimension is selected.
% 
% This function returns statistics on the proportion of false nearest neighbors
% as a function of the embedding dimension m = m_{min}, m_{min}+1, ..., m_{max}
% for a given time lag tau, and distance threshold for neighbors, d_{th}.
% 
% Outputs include the proportion of false nearest neighbors at each m, the mean
% and spread, and the smallest m at which the proportion of false nearest
% neighbors drops below each of a set of fixed thresholds.
