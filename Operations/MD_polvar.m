% MD_polvar
% 
% Calculates the POLVARd measure for a time series.
% The first mention may be in Wessel et al., PRE (2000), called Plvar
% cf. "Short-term forecasting of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias based on
% symbolic dynamics and finite-time growth rates",
%       N. Wessel et al., Phys. Rev. E 61(1) 733 (2000)
% 
% The output from this function is the probability of obtaining a sequence of
% consecutive ones or zeros.
% 
% Although the original measure used raw thresholds, d, on RR interval sequences
% (measured in milliseconds), this code can be applied to general z-scored time
% series. So now d is not the time difference in milliseconds, but in units of
% std.
% 
% The measure was originally applied to sequences of RR intervals and this code
% is heavily derived from that provided by Max A. Little, January 2009.
% cf. http://www.maxlittle.net/
% 
% INPUTS:
% x, the input time series
% d, the symbolic coding (amplitude) difference,
% D, the word length (classically words of length 6).
% 
% OUPUT:
% p - probability of obtaining a sequence of consecutive ones/zeros
