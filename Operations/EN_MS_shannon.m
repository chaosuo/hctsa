% EN_MS_shannon
% 
% Calculates the approximate Shannon entropy of a time series using an
% nbin-bin encoding and depth-symbol sequences.
% Uniform population binning is used, and the implementation uses Michael Small's code
% MS_shannon.m (renamed from the original, simply shannon.m)
% 
% cf. M. Small, Applied Nonlinear Time Series Analysis: Applications in Physics,
% Physiology, and Finance (book) World Scientific, Nonlinear Science Series A,
% Vol. 52 (2005)
% Michael Small's code is available at available at http://small.eie.polyu.edu.hk/matlab/
% 
% In this wrapper function, you can evaluate the code at a given n and d, and
% also across a range of depth and nbin to return statistics on how the obtained
% entropies change.
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input time series
% nbin, the number of bins to discretize the time series into (i.e., alphabet size)
% depth, the length of strings to analyze
