% SC_fastdfa
% 
% Measures the scaling exponent of the time series using a fast implementation
% of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).
% 
% The original fastdfa code is by Max A. Little and publicly-available at
% http://www.maxlittle.net/software/index.php
%
% INPUTS,
% y, the input time series, is fed straight into the fastdfa script.
