% This operation splits the time series into segments, computes the mean and
% variance in each segment and compares the maximum and minimum mean to the mean
% variance.
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input time series
% 
% howl, (i) 'fix': fixed-length segments (of length l)
%       (ii) 'num': a given number, l, of segments
%       
% l, either the length ('fix') or number of segments ('num')
