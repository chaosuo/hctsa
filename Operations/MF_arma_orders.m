% MF_ARMA_orders
% 
% Given a set of AR orders, p, and a set of MA orders, q, this operation fits
% ARMA(p,q) models to the time series and evaluates the goodness of fit from all
% combinations (p,q).
% 
% Uses functions iddata, armax, and aic from Matlab's System Identification toolbox
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input time series
% pr, a vector specifying the range of AR model orders to analyze
% qr, a vector specifying the range of MA model orders to analyze
% 
% Outputs are statistics on the appropriateness of different types of models,
% including the goodness of fit from the best model, and the optimal orders of
% fitted ARMA(p,q) models.
% 
% ** Future improvements **
% (1) May want to quantify where a particular order starts to stand out, i.e.,
% may be quite sensitive to wanting p > 2, but may be quite indiscriminate
% when it comes to the MA order.
% (2) May want to do some prediction and get more statistics on quality of
% model rather than just in-sample FPE/AIC...
