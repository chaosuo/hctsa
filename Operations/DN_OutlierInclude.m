% DN_OutlierInclude
% 
% Measures a range of different statistics about the time series as more and
% more outliers are included in the calculation according to a specified rule:
% 
% (i) 'abs': outliers are furthest from the mean,
% (ii) 'p': outliers are the greatest positive deviations from the mean, or
% (iii) 'n': outliers are the greatest negative deviations from the mean.
% 
% The threshold for including time-series data points in the analysis increases
% from zero to the maximum deviation, in increments of 0.01*sigma (by default),
% where sigma is the standard deviation of the time series.
% 
% At each threshold, the mean, standard error, proportion of time series points
% included, median, and standard deviation are calculated, and outputs from the
% algorithm measure how these statistical quantities change as more extreme
% points are included in the calculation.
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input time series (ideally z-scored)
% 
% howth, the method of how to determine outliers: 'abs', 'p', or 'n' (see above
%           for descriptions)
% 
% inc, the increment to move through (fraction of std if input time series is
%       z-scored)
% 
% Most of the outputs measure either exponential, i.e., f(x) = Aexp(Bx)+C, or
% linear, i.e., f(x) = Ax + B, fits to the sequence of statistics obtained in
% this way.
% 
% [future: could compare differences in outputs obtained with 'p', 'n', and
%               'abs' -- could give an idea as to asymmetries/nonstationarities??]
