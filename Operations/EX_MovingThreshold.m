% EX_MovingThreshold
% 
% A measure based on a moving threshold model for extreme events. Inspired by an
% idea contained in the following paper:
% "Reactions to extreme events: Moving threshold model"
% Altmann et al., Physica A 364, 435--444 (2006)
% 
% This algorithm is based on this idea: it uses the occurrence of extreme events
% to modify a hypothetical 'barrier' that classes new points as 'extreme' or not.
% The barrier begins at sigma, and if the absolute value of the next data point
% is greater than the barrier, the barrier is increased by a proportion 'a',
% otherwise the position of the barrier is decreased by a proportion 'b'.
% 
% INPUTS:
% y, the input (z-scored) time series
% a, the barrier jump parameter (in extreme event)
% b, the barrier decay proportion (in absence of extreme event)
% 
% Outputs are the mean, spread, maximum, and minimum of the time series for the
% barrier, the mean of the difference between the barrier and the time series
% values, and statistics on the occurrence of 'kicks' (times at which the
% threshold is modified), and by how much the threshold changes on average.
% 
% In future could make a variant operation that optimizes a and b to minimize the
% quantity meanqover/pkick (hugged the shape as close as possible with the
% minimum number of kicks), and returns a and b...?

%% Preliminaries
N = length(y); % time-series length
y = abs(y); % extreme events defined in terms of absolute deviation from mean
q = zeros(N,1); % the barrier
kicks = zeros(N,1);

% Treat the barrier as knowing nothing about the time series, until it encounters it
% (except for the std! -- starts at 1)

% Initial condition of barrier q:
% The barrier will get smarter about the distribution
% but will decay to simulate 'forgetfulness' in the original model(!)

q(1) = 1; % begin at sigma

for i = 2:N
	if y(i) > q(i-1) % Extreme event -- time series value more extreme than the barrier
		% q(i) = (1+a)*q(i-1); % increase barrier by proportion a
		q(i) = (1+a)*y(i); % increase barrier above the new observation by a factor a
		kicks(i) = q(i) - q(i-1); % The size of the increase
	else
		q(i) = (1-b)*q(i-1); % Decrease barrier by proportion b

% Kicks
out.pkick = sum(kicks)/(N-1); % probability of a kick

I_kick = diff(fkicks); % time intervals between successive kicks
out.stdkickf = std(I_kick);
out.meankickf = mean(I_kick);
