% Implements an idea based on the periodicity extraction measure proposed in:

% This function detrends the time series using a single-knot cubic regression
% spline, and then computes autocorrelations up to one third of the length of
% the time series. The frequency is the first peak in the autocorrelation
% function satisfying a set of conditions.
% 
% INPUTS,
% y, the input time series.
% 
% The single threshold of 0.01 was considered in the original paper, this code
% uses a range of thresholds: 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 1\sqrt{N}, 5\sqrt{N}, and
% 10\sqrt{N}, where N is the length of the time series.

%% Check that a Curve-Fitting Toolbox license is available:
BF_CheckToolbox('curve_fitting_toolbox')

%% Preliminaries:
doplot = 0; % plot outputs to figure

% Check the time series is z-scored:
if ~BF_iszscored(y)
    warning('The input time series should be z-scored')
end

%% Foreplay
N = length(y); % length of the time series
ths = [0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 1/sqrt(N), 5/sqrt(N), 10/sqrt(N)]; % the thresholds with which to count a peak
nths = length(ths); % the number of thresholds

%% 1: Detrend using a regression spline with 3 knots
% I'm not quite sure how to do this, but I'm doing it like this:
% y_or=y; % the original series
% r=linspace(1,N,3);% range for spline (3 knots)
% y_sp=spline(1:N,y,r); % fit the spline on the data, y
% respline=spline(r,y_sp,1:N);
% y=y-respline'; % the detrended series

spline = spap2(2,4,1:N,y); % just a single middle knot with cubic interpolants
y_spl = fnval(spline,1:N); % evaluated at the 1:N time intervals
y = y - y_spl';
if doplot
    figure('color','w'); box('on');
    plot(y_or,'k'); hold on; plot(y,'r'); hold off
end

%% 2. Compute autocorrelations up to 1/3 the length of the time series.
acmax = ceil(N/3); % compute autocorrelations up to this lag
acf = zeros(acmax,1); % the autocorrelation function
for i = 1:acmax % i is the \tau, the AC lag
    acf(i) = mean(y(1:N-i).*y(i+1:N));
end
if doplot
    figure('color','w'); box('on');
    plot(acf,'k')
    title('Autocorrelation')
end

%% 3. Frequency is the first peak satisfying the following conditions:
% (a) a trough before it
% (b) difference between peak and trough is at least 0.01
% (c) peak corresponds to positive correlation

% (i) find peaks and troughs in ACF
diffac = diff(acf); % differenced time series
sgndiffac = sign(diffac); % sign of differenced time series
bath = diff(sgndiffac); % differenced, signed, differenced time series
troughs = find(bath == 2) + 1; % finds troughs
peaks = find(bath == -2) + 1; % finds peaks
npeaks = length(peaks);

thefreqs = zeros(nths,1);
for k = 1:nths
    thefreqs(k) = 1;
    for i = 1:npeaks % search through all peaks for one that meets the condition
        ipeak = peaks(i); % acf lag at which there is a peak
        thepeak = acf(ipeak); % acf at the peak
        ftrough = find(troughs < ipeak,1,'last');
        if isempty(ftrough); continue; end
        itrough = troughs(ftrough); % acf lag at which there is a trough (the first one preceeding the peak)
        thetrough = acf(itrough); % acf at the trough
        
        % (a) a trough before it: should be implicit in the ftrough bit above
        %     if troughs(1)>ipeak % the first trough is after it
        %         continue
        %     end
        
        % (b) difference between peak and trough is at least 0.01
        if thepeak - thetrough < ths(k)
            continue
        end
        
        % (c) peak corresponds to positive correlation
        if thepeak < 0
