% MD_pNN
% 
% Applies pNNx measures to time series assumed to represent sequences of
% consecutive RR intervals measured in milliseconds.

% cf. "The pNNx files: re-examining a widely used heart rate variability
%           measure", J.E. Mietus et al., Heart 88(4) 378 (2002)
% 
% INPUTS,
% x, the input time series
% 
% This code is derived from MD_hrv_classic.m becuase it doesn't make medical
% sense to do PNN on a z-scored time series.
% 
% But now PSD doesn't make too much sense, so we just evaluate the pNN measures.
% 
% Code is heavily derived from that provided by Max A. Little:
